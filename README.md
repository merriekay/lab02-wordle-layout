# Lab02: Wordle Layout with CSS Flexbox

## 🎯 Goal
Learn CSS Flexbox by building a Wordle-style game board layout. You'll transform a broken starter layout into a clean, centered 6×5 grid that looks like the real Wordle game.

## 📚 What You'll Learn
- How `display: flex` transforms layouts instantly
- The difference between horizontal and vertical centering
- Why `gap` is better than `margin` for spacing
- How to center content on a webpage
- CSS pseudo-selectors like `:not(:empty)`

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Open the lab instructions:** [Lab02: Wordle Layout](https://hackmd.io/@profmoore/Lab02-wordle-layout)
2. **Launch your code:** Open `index.html` in VS Code Live Server or your browser
3. **Follow the experiments:** Work through each step in the lab guide
4. **Edit `style.css`** to complete the layout challenges

## 🧪 Lab Structure
The lab walks you through **6 experiments** that build up your Flexbox skills:
