# Wordle-ish Starter

## Goal
Use Flexbox to lay out a Wordle-style board (rows and tiles).  
Later, youâ€™ll add JS for input + coloring.

## Getting Started
- Open `index.html` in your browser (or use VS Code Live Server).
- Edit `styles.css` to adjust layout (board, rows, tiles).
- Commit and push your changes.

## Flexbox Targets
- `.board` is a **column** of `.row`s.
- Each `.row` is a **row** of `.tile`s.
- Use `gap`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` as needed.
